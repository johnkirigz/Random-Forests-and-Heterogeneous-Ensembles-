# Random-Forests-and-Heterogeneous-Ensembles
# Insurance and churn_modelling datasets
I loaded the insurance.csv and churn_modelling.csv dataset and investigated the variables' relationships. I preprocessed the data by dealing with missing values, encoding categorical variables, and dividing it into training and testing sets. After that, i trained and improved a Random Forest Regression model and tested its performance on the testing data set. Lastly, i trained and assessed a Heterogeneous Ensemble model on the testing set. For both models, the MSE was utilized as an evaluation statistic.
